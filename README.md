# DynamicUI

Dynamic UI components made using vanilla JavaScript. No dependencies. I made it for learning purposes. And I'm still learning. So, it's not perfect. But it works.

Inspired by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-dynamic-user-interface-interactions).
